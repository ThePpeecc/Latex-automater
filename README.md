### Introduktion
Hi, I created this project to make writing LaTeX reports more fun, and less tedios for me.
The project takes care 'as of now' of all the compiling of .tex files. It also has a nifty feature where it auto compiles the files when you save a .tex document.

### Installation

This project relies on the pdflatex command, so make sure that you have it installed.
It also relies on npm, so make sure it also is installed.

Other than that. Navigate to the folder in your terminal, and run:
  npm install
´´
